1. Read through the following code
    def print_numbers(list):
        for i in range(1, len(list)+1):
            print(list[i])
â€‹
    num_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    print_numbers(num_list)
In your notebook
Write down any bugs that you see in the program

//its going to say list index out of range

2. Read through the following code
    def swapping_stars():
    line_str = ""
        for line in range(0, 6):
            for char in range(0,6):
                if line % 2 == char % 2:
                    line_str += "*"
                else:
                    line_str += "-"
    print(line_str)
Continue in your notebook
Write down any bugs that you see in the program

//every 6 and 1 they repeat

3. In script mode
Fix the 2 programs above.
Create a program that asks the user which function they would like to run.
